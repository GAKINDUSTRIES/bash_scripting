# Bash scripting

The command line is one of the most powerful tools for a Linux/UNIX user. Bash is the default login shell on Linux and Mac OS (you can use others like zsh, csh, fish,etc) and adding it to your skillset will open up a whole new world of possibilities. It gives you access to a huge number of command line utilities, simplifying many everyday tasks. But Bash also provides you with a powerful scripting language for automating just about anything. For remote access and system administration, Bash is an absolute must.
Whether you are a system administrator, a developer or a power user, shell scripts will make you more productive.

The aim of this repository is to provide a quick reference of the basic commands and functions that bash has, as well as giving some examples that might help to understand more about it.

Notice that this does NOT intend to be a tutorial or full documentation about bash, and you may want to check on the man page for a deeper explanation.

Hope it helps!
